Memory Allocation Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various memory allocation algorithms. These algorithms are essential for managing memory in operating systems.

Algorithms Implemented

First Fit: Allocates the first free partition that is large enough.
Next Fit: Allocates the next free partition that is larger enough.
Best Fit: Allocates the smallest free partition that is adequate.
Worst Fit: Allocates the largest available partition.
